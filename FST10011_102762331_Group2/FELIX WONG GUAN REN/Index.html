			<p>Throughout the human history, shoes have been the most essential thing a human must have in their life. This is because the shoe protects our leg when we carry most of our daily activities such as walking, running, and even standing from all kinds of injuries. With the improvement in technologies, shoe can now be in various kind of shape with various type of new feature added to them. Some can be design by celebrities and some could have a special feature at allow you to last longer while walking.</p>

			<p>This website is a shoes review website which we will give you about our opinion on a specific shoe. This is to prevent you from regret your buying decision. Other than that, this website will be review a wide variety of shoes from sport shoes to sneakers. For your information, sneakers type of shoes is street wear shoe which is more fashionable and more comfortable. But everything come with a price, sneakers type of shoe is more expensive because of its design make it special from sport shoe.

			<p>For the sport shoe, sport shoe can be divided into different kind of sport such as basketball, football, running. Personally, I am a basketball player so my expertise is more onto basketball type sport shoe but do not worry, the website will have the review of various kind of sport shoe type. In my opinion, I think that sport shoe is so much better than sneakers. This is because not only sport shoe can protect your feet from injuries, but it is also durable and fashionable at the same time with price much cheaper than most of the sneaker. For example, Adidas AlphaBounce which have a very unique design and comfortable to wear with the price of RM500.</p>
