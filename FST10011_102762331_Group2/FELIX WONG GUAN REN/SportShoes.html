For this reason, the shoe’s price is high than a normal basketball shoe. But everything come with cost, this is one of the highest reviews and famous basketball shoe on internet due to its stylish design and features designate for the sport basketball. Some of the features is great traction allow player’s foot has greater grip of the floor.

Moreover, because of the shape that protect the basketball player’s ankle, it causes wearing the shoe will be hard which you need to force your foot into the shoe. Finally, the shoe is not good for hard landings. </p>

				<li><h2>Nike Premier Firm Ground</h2></li>
				
			<img src="Images/soccer shoe.png" title="Nike Premier Firm Ground" alt="Nike Premier Firm Ground">
			
			<p>Nike Premier Firm Ground is a Nike brand soccer shoe which is one of the top 5 best soccer shoe in the world cost about RM350. For a shoe this cheap with many features is consider as a very nice deal in my opinion. There are many things that make this shoe great, first, the shoe is comfortable. This is because the shoe is mostly made of fabric with make it soft and smooth when wearing. Other than that, the shoe has a great design which make the shoe looking good when wearing to play soccer. Next, the shoe is made from good quality materials, a type of fabric that will increase comfortability after a long time of wearing. Finally, the shoe has many spikes. If you are a soccer player, you will understand why a soccer shoe must have many spikes. For some of you, the reason is that spikes allow to hold onto dirt more to allow soccer play not slipper when the grass is wet.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>There are also some cons about this shoe. One of them is that the shoe is heavy especially for a sport that involve a lot of running, soccer. This will cause soccer player to need more effort to run when wearing the shoe. Other than that, the size of the shoe is hard to choose because the shoe size needs to be exactly fit your foot size or else it will cause discomfort when wearing.</p>
